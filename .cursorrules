# Post-Work Verification Rules
After completing any coding task, you MUST perform the following steps:

1.  **Run All Tests**:
    - Execute the full test suite for the project.
    - Ensure all tests pass.
    - If any tests fail, you MUST fix the failures before considering the task complete.

2.  **Check README.md**:
    - Review `README.md` to see if it needs to be updated with any new information related to the changes you made.
    - **Length Constraint**: Ensure `README.md` is NOT longer than 200 lines. If it exceeds this limit, condense the content while retaining essential information.

3.  **Update Documentation & Comments**:
    - **Architecture**: If you changed data flow or core components, update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
    - **Debugging**: If you added new external dependencies or complex logic, update `docs/DEBUGGING.md`.
    - **JSDoc**: Ensure all new or modified exported functions in `src/lib` have accurate JSDoc comments.

# Tech Stack & Constraints
- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Maps**: React-Leaflet / Leaflet
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting

# Coding Style
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks. Prefer small, focused components.
- **Icons**: Use `lucide-react` for icons.
- **Logic**: Ensure all geometric calculations in `src/lib` have unit tests.
- **State**: Keep state local where possible, lift up only when necessary.
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strictly. Avoid `any`.
