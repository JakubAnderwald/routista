# Post-Work Verification Rules
After completing any coding task, you MUST perform the following steps:

1.  **Run All Tests**:
    - Execute the full test suite for the project.
    - Ensure all tests pass.
    - If any tests fail, you MUST fix the failures before considering the task complete.

2.  **Check README.md**:
    - Review `README.md` to see if it needs to be updated with any new information related to the changes you made.
    - **Length Constraint**: Ensure `README.md` is NOT longer than 200 lines. If it exceeds this limit, condense the content while retaining essential information.
