# Routista 🏃‍♂️🎨

Turn any shape into a real-world GPS route! Routista is a fun, free tool for runners, cyclists, and explorers who want to create GPS art or just spice up their training.

## Features ✨

- **Shape-to-Route Magic**: Upload an image (logo, symbol, drawing) or draw directly on the map, and Routista will find the best matching roads in your chosen area.
- **Interactive Mapping**: Powered by Leaflet, select any location in the world to generate your route.
- **GPX Export**: Download your generated route as a GPX file compatible with Strava, Garmin, and other fitness apps.
- **Privacy Focused**: All processing happens in your browser (client-side) or securely.
- **Completely Free**: No paywalls or subscriptions. Supported by coffee! ☕

## How It Works 🛠️

1.  **Select Area**: Choose where you want to run or cycle.
2.  **Input Shape**: Upload an image or draw a shape.
3.  **Generate**: The algorithm processes the shape and snaps it to real-world streets using routing algorithms.
4.  **Export**: Get your GPX file and go!
